## About This Workshop

This workshop was developed for the **Young Investigators Symposium of the Skintegrity Network** to introduce researchers to bulk RNA-seq data analysis using R and Bioconductor. It focuses on practical understanding and hands-on application of fundamental analysis steps, from data import to differential expression and enrichment analysis.

### 🎯 Who is it for?

This workshop is designed for:
- Researchers with little or no prior experience in RNA-seq analysis
- Students and early-stage postdocs in the biomedical/life sciences
- Participants who have basic familiarity with R (e.g., creating variables, loading packages)

### 🧬 Scientific context

RNA-seq is a powerful tool for understanding gene expression changes in health and disease. Differential expression analysis is the most common type of analysis for RNA-seq data.

### 🏗️ Workshop format

This is a one-day introductory course combining:  
✅ Short presentations for conceptual understanding  
✅ Step-by-step guided exercises in R  
✅ Group discussion and Q&A
