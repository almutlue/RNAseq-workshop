Basic familiarity with R (loading libraries, running scripts, inspecting objects) is useful, but not required.\nAcross the exercises, you will:\n\n‚úÖ Load RNA-seq count data\n\n‚úÖ Create Bioconductor data objects\n\n‚úÖ Perform exploratory data analysis and quality control\n\n‚úÖ Run differential expression analysis\n\n‚úÖ Conduct functional enrichment\n\nThese exercises are intentionally short and guided to complement the workshop presentation and group discussions."
