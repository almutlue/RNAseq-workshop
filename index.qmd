### Overview

These exercises and presentations are part of a **two-day RNA-seq data analysis workshop** presented at the **Young Investigators Symposium of the Skintegrity Network**. They provide a hands-on introduction to processing, exploring, and analyzing RNA-seq count data using R and Bioconductor.

The content is **adapted and simplified** from the *Carpentries Incubator course*  
**“RNA-seq Analysis with Bioconductor”**  
👉 https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/bioc-rnaseq/  
which are highly recommended for further in-depth learning.

The single cell RNAseq exercises are **adapted and simplified** from the *SIB Single Cell Training* resources.
👉 https://sib-swiss.github.io/single-cell-training/ 

Before starting, please ensure that **all required R and Bioconductor packages are installed** using the script provided in `src/install.R` or run in an R Terminal:

```r
install.packages(c("BiocManager", "remotes", "dplyr"))
BiocManager::install(c("SummarizedExperiment", "airway", "AnnotationDbi",
                        "org.Mm.eg.db", "DESeq2", "Seurat", "GEOquery",
                        "clusterProfiler", "vsn"))
```

Basic familiarity with R (loading libraries, running scripts, inspecting objects) is useful, but not required.

Across the exercises, you will:

- ✅ Load RNA-seq count data  
- ✅ Create Bioconductor data objects  
- ✅ Perform exploratory data analysis and quality control  
- ✅ Run differential expression analysis  
- ✅ Conduct functional enrichment  

These exercises are intentionally short and guided to complement the workshop presentation and group discussions.
