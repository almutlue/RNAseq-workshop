## RNAseq workshop exercises

This repo contains exercises and presentations that are part of a two-day RNA-seq data analysis workshop presented at the Young Investigators Symposium of the Skintegrity Network. They provide a hands-on introduction to processing, exploring, and analyzing RNA-seq count data using R and Bioconductor, as well as exercises for single cell RNAseq analysis using Seurat

### 🎯 Who is it for?

This workshop is designed for:
- Researchers with little or no prior experience in RNA-seq analysis
- Students and early-stage postdocs in the biomedical/life sciences
- Participants who have basic familiarity with R (e.g., creating variables, loading packages)

### 📋 Prerequisites
To run the exercises please make sure to install all packages from the `install.R` script.

### 🧬 Scientific context

RNA-seq is a powerful tool for understanding gene expression changes in health and disease. Differential expression analysis is the most common type of analysis for RNA-seq data.

### 🏗️ Workshop format

This is a two-day introductory course combining:  
+ Short presentations for conceptual understanding  
+ Step-by-step guided exercises in R  
+ Group discussion and Q&A
