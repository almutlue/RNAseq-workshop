## The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology

## The Reality is more complex ...
::: incremental
-   RNA is not only a messenger but may have other roles
-   Most of these elements interacts and regulates one-another
-   Additional layer of complexity through alternative splicing

## What are we sequencing?
#### Genomics
- Whole genome/exome sequencing (WGS/WES)
- Variant calling (SNPs, CNVs, structural variations)

#### Epigenomics
- Bisulphite sequencing : DNA methylation
- ATAC-Seq : chromatine opening
- ChIP-seq : TF binding sites

## What are we sequencing? {.scrollable}
#### Transcriptomics
- Total RNA
- Poly-A tail selection : focus on mRNA
- Ribo depletion: mRNA + ncRNA
- 5'/3' RACE seq : isoform characterization for one gene
- single cell RNAseq
- Long read RNA sequencing
- Spatial Transcriptomics

many more ...

## Why bulk RNA-seq still matters in the era of single cell RNA-seq

. . .

<br/> Cost-effectiveness and Scalability

::: incremental
- Bulk RNA-seq is orders of magnitude cheaper
- Enables large cohorts (hundreds–thousands of samples)
- Essential for population-level or clinical studies
:::

## Why bulk RNA-seq still matters in the era of single cell RNA-seq

. . .

<br/> Higher Data Quality per Gene

::: incremental
- Deeper sequencing per transcript → better quantification
- Less technical noise, no dropouts
- More reliable differential expression results
:::

## Why bulk RNA-seq still matters in the era of single cell RNA-seq

. . .

<br/> Simplicity and Robustness

::: incremental
- Well-established workflows and QC pipelines
- Works with degraded/frozen tissues (recent scRNAseq techniques as well)
- More robust against batch effects
- Relative high reproducibility across labs
:::

. . .

<br/> Biological Interpretability

::: incremental
- Average expression is often the relevant measure for tissue-level processes
- Examples: Treatment effects on cell line, Developmental stages, Systemic disease states
