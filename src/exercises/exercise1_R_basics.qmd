This section introduces essential R skills needed for the RNA-seq workshop. Explanations will be covered in the presentation; here we focus on practical steps.

---

## R and RStudio

### Exercise 1: Open a project

Open RStudio and create a new **R Project** in a folder called `rnaseq_workshop`.

### Exercise 2: Try the Console

In the Console, type:

```r
2 + 5
"Hello, RNAseq!"
```
### Exercise 3: Create and run a script

1. Create a new R script called `intro.R`.
2. Add the following code:

```r
# My first script
3 * 4
```
3. Run the line using `Ctrl/Cmd` + `Enter`.

## Objects and Classes

### Exercise 4: Create some basic objects

```r
genes <- 20000
sample_name <- "Sample1"
is_control <- TRUE
```
### Exercise 5: Check object classes

```r
class(genes)
class(sample_name)
class(is_control)
```

### Exercise 6: Create and explore a vector

```r
counts <- c(10, 50, 200, 0)
length(counts)

```

## Bioconductor

### Exercise 7: Load the package

```r
library(SummarizedExperiment)
```

### Exercise 8: Load example dataset

The package come with some example data, that can be loaded using the `example()` function.

```r
example(SE)
```

### Exercise 9: Explore the object

You can use the following functions to access different parts of the object. Try to answer the following questions:
1. What does the output represent?
2. What is the advantage of combining these different parts of the data (e.g. metadata, count data)?
3. [BONUS] How can you downsample the object to the first 10 features? Check the [vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/SummarizedExperiment/inst/doc/SummarizedExperiment.html) or ask a LLM, if you need help. 

```r
se
assay(se)
colData(se)
rowData(se)
```

### Exercise 10: Determine dataset size

```r
dim(se)      # rows = genes/features, cols = samples
nrow(se)     # number of rows (features)
ncol(se)     # number of columns (samples)

```
